                    <h2>About Eduserve</h2>
                    <span class="divider">_______________________</span>
                    <p>On 12th February 2015, Eduserve took shape when three aspiring entrepreneurs came together with a
                        common goal of dedication to philanthropy. Eduserve, a non-profit organization is passionate
                        about educating the under-privileged children. With nobility as a cause, Eduserve contemplates
                        to open the world of knowledge and harness achievers in all walks of life, by empowering
                        children eager to open the doors of success to enhance their lives through education.
                        Eduserve proposes to offer aid, support and assistance, to under-privileged children to
                        enable them to get an education without discrimination on the basis of caste, class, race
                        and religion. By proactively sponsoring them and offering scholarship for orphans and
                        especially those who’s parents are unable to afford to educate them; the purpose will be
                        established. While each child’s completion of education is our main aim, Eduserve strives to
                        support them in terms of aid, until each child is gainfully employed and able to support
                        themselves. In order for these children to outshine, Eduserve , alongside education, endeavors
                        to help enrich emotional well-being and inculcate health care. In the wake of calamities,
                        Eduserve wants to contribute by bearing auxiliary expenses including medical expenses,
                        educational expenses and taking on a social responsibility by creating public awareness and
                        concern towards welfare contributions during such calamity relief in times of famines and flood
                        disasters</p>

                    Refinement being essential, Eduserve plans to actively participate in checking the child`s IQ level
                    and also interest and talents in other activities so that could also be encouraged and developed
                    through enrolling them in various extracurricular activities. Eduserve will spread its wings to
                    meet the children`s teachers and taking them into confidence and enlisting their help and support
                    in the child`s progress. Eduserve proposes to counsel parents by helping them to understand the
                    importance of educating their children in order to give them a better future, and imbue how a good
                    education could change not only the child`s life for the better, but that the entire family would
                    benefit in the long term. Eduserve aims to incorporate opening up a person’s mind to correct factual
                    knowledge to break dogmas and traditions to build up confidence and cohesiveness among children so
                    they can protect themselves from becoming victims of violence and abuse.
